## v0.20.0

- Huge refactor of internals. Got rid of all string representations for Atoms, so store should only contain valid data. All Resources have all required props, and data is of the correct datatype.

- Added collection sorting #63

## v0.19.0

- Added table view for `atomic-server` #53
- Changed many methods from the `Resource` API to fix some ownership / trait object issues #45. `Resource` no longer has an internal reference to `Store`, so it needs an explicit store in most methods.

- Atomic-cli 0.18.0 allows for instantiating new Resources, whilst creating commits! It also re-introduces the TPF query.

## v0.17.1

- Atomic-server 0.17.1 now automatically renews HTTPS certificates on boot, if needed.
