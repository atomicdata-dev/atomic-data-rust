## When should you use this

- You want to make (high-value) datasets as easily accessible as possible
- You want to specify and share a common vocabulary / ontology / schema for some specific domain or dataset. Example classes [here](https://atomicdata.dev/classes).
- You want to use and share linked data, but don't want to deal with most of [the complexities of RDF](https://docs.atomicdata.dev/interoperability/rdf.html), SPARQL, Triple Stores, Named Graphs and Blank Nodes.
- You are interested in re-decentralizing the web or want want to work with tech that improves data ownership and interoperability.
- You like living on the edge (this application is not production ready)

## When _not_ to use this

- If you need stability or reliability, look further (for now).
- You're dealing with non-public / private data. As of now, this server does not have methods to prevent access to content.
- Complex query requirements. Check out NEO4j, Apache Jena or maybe TerminusDB.

## Installation & getting started

You can run `atomic-server` in four ways:

- From a published [binary](https://github.com/joepio/atomic/releases) (probably the quickest)
- Using docker
- Using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) from crates.io: `cargo install atomic-server`
- Manually from source

When you're running `atomic-server`, go to [Initial setup and configuration](#Initial-setup-and-configuration)

### Run as binary

After installing from `cargo install atomic-server` or as a binary, run `atomic-server`.
Run `atomic-server --help` to learn more about the available commands, such as `export`, `import` and various flags.

### Run using docker

The `dockerfile` is located in the project root, above this `server` folder.

- Run: `docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v atomic-storage:/atomic-storage joepmeneer/atomic-server`
- If you want to update, run `docker pull joepmeneer/atomic-server` and docker should fetch the latest version.

### Install from source

```sh
# Clone this repoo
git clone git@github.com:joepio/atomic-data-rust.git
cd atomic-data-rust/server
# Optional, but recommended: Create a new .env using the template.
cp default.env .env
# Run the server. It creates a store in ~/.config/atomic/db by default
cargo run
# Or tun the extra-cool desktop version with a presence in your app tray
cargo run --features desktop
# If you don't need HTTPS (or don't have OpenSSL available on your device)
cargo run --no-default-features
```

Troubleshooting compiling from source:

```sh
# If pkg-config or libssl-dev is not installed, make sure to install them
sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config libssl-dev --fix-missing
```

## Initial setup and configuration

- You can configure the server by passing arguments (see `atomic-server --help`), or by setting ENV variables.
- The server loads the `.env` from the current path by default. Create a `.env` file from the default template in your current directory with `atomic-server setup-env`.
- After running the server, check the logs and take note of the `Agent Subject` and `Private key`. You should use these in the [`atomic-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/atomic-cli) and [atomic-data-browser](https://github.com/joepio/atomic-data-browser) clients for authorization.
- A directory is made: `~/.config/atomic`, which stores your newly created Agent keys, your data, the HTTPS certificates and a folder for public static files.
- Visit `http://localhost:9883/setup` to **register your first (admin) user**. You can use an existing Agent, or create a new one.

### HTTPS Setup

You'll probably want to make your Atomic Data available through HTTPS.
You can use the embedded HTTPS / TLS setup powered by [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), [acme_lib](https://docs.rs/acme-lib/0.8.1/acme_lib/index.html) and [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls).

You can do this by passing these flags:

Run the server: `atomic-server --https --email some@example.com --domain example.com`.

You can also set these things using a `.env` or by setting them some other way.

Make sure the server is accessible at `ATOMIC_DOMAIN` at port 80, because Let's Encrypt will send an HTTP request to this server's `/.well-known` directory to check the keys.
The default Ports are `9883` for HTTP, and `9884` for HTTPS.
If you're running the server publicly, set these to `80` and `433`: `atomic-server --https --port 80 --port-https 433`.
It will now initialize the certificate.
Read the logs, watch for errors.

HTTPS certificates are automatically renewed when the server is restarted, and the certs are 4 weeks or older.
They are stored in your `.config/atomic/` dir.

## Usage

There are three ways to interact with this server:

- **GUI**: Use the [`atomic-data-browser`](https://github.com/joepio/atomic-data-browser) JS frontend by visiting `localhost`.
- **API**: Check out [./example_requests.http](./example_requests.http) for various HTTP requests to the server. Also, [read the docs](https://docs.atomicdata.dev/). You can also try the [react boilerplate](https://codesandbox.io/s/atomic-data-react-template-4y9qu?file=/src/MyResource.tsx:0-1223) to build your own front-end app using [@tomic/lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomic/lib) and [@tomic/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomic/react).
- **CLI**: The [`atomic-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/atomic-cli/0.24.2) terminal app

### Use `atomic-cli` as client

`atomic-cli` is a useful terminal tool for interacting with `atomic-server`.
It makes it easy to query and edit Atomic Data from the command line.
[Check it out](https://github.com/joepio/atomic/tree/master/cli).

### API

You can fetch individual items by sending a GET request to their URL.

```sh
# Fetch as JSON-AD (de facto standard for Atomic Data)
curl -i -H "Accept: application/ad+json" https://atomicdata.dev/properties/shortname
# Fetch as JSON-LD
curl -i -H "Accept: application/ld+json" https://atomicdata.dev/properties/shortname
# Fetch as JSON
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" https://atomicdata.dev/properties/shortname
# Fetch as Turtle / N3
curl -i -H "Accept: text/turtle" https://atomicdata.dev/properties/shortname
```

Check out [./example_requests.http](/example_requests.http) for more things that you can do.
Also, read the [Atomic Data Docs](https://docs.atomicdata.dev/) to learn more about Collections, Commits, JSON-AD and other concepts used here.

## Testing

```sh
# This also makes sure that cli and server work, plus it test the db feature
cargo test --all
```

## Performance benchmarking

```sh
# Install drill
cargo install drill
drill -b benchmark.yml --stats
```

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Can / should I create backups?

Yes! You should. Especially before installing a newer Atomic-Server version, it might be imcompatible with the previous database model and could corrupt the database.
Run `atomic-server export` to create a backup in your `~/.config/atomic/backups` folder.
Import them using `atomic-server import -p ~/.config/atomic/backups/${date}.json`.

### I lost the key / secret to my Root Agent, and the `/setup` invite is no longer usable! What now?

You can run `atomic-server --initialize` to recreate the `/setup` invite. It will be reset to `1` usage.

### How do I migrate my data to a new domain?

There are no helper functions for this, but you could `atomic-server export` your JSON-AD, and find + replace your old domain with the new one.
This could especially be helpful if you're running at `localhost` and want to move to a live server.

### How do I reset my database?

Remove the `db` folder in your `atomic` config: `rm -rf ~/.config/atomic/db`.

### How do I make my data private, yet available online?

This is not yet possible. See [#13](https://github.com/joepio/atomic-data-rust/issues/13).

### Collections are empty / TPF is not working / search is empty

You might have a problem with your indexes.
Try rebuilding the indexes using `atomic-server --rebuild-index`.

### I get a `failed to retrieve` error when opening

Try re-initializing atomic server `atomic-server --initialize`.
